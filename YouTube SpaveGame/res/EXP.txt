This game was my by Elliot Lee-Cerrino 
for LudumDare 26 the theme was minimallisum

in this game you are the captin of a mining vessle
but your ship has strayed off course 

now you must fight your way out of the asteroid field
or never make it home with your precious cargo

seriously thats all i've got literally as im typing this
i'm falling to sleep so please just put up with it i know
its horrible and boring but al you have to do is push spacebar
and you will leave this dreaed place
